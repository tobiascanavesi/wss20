# [WSS20] Local Dimension Measure and Rotation Groups in Wolfram Models 
My project of the Wolfram Summer School 2020
- Project goal: The first goal of this project is to find a way to calculate a local dimension measure (i.e. better than the current logarithmic-difference approximation) and then if it’s possible to reconstruct a discrete approximation to SO(n) for integer-dimensional hypergraphs.
- Computational strategy:
The Wolfram Model is a discrete spacetime formalism in which space is represented by a hypergraph whose evolution dynamics are determined by replacement operations on set systems, and in which the conformal structure of spacetime is represented by a causal graph. Using all the resources available to create the Wolfram Physics Project, together with the power of all the functions that Wolfram Language has, we will study global and local dimensions for several hypergraphs. To do this we will use as a dimension estimator the number of vertices as a function of their volume N∼r^d, and then we investigate hypergraph automorphism groups that preserve the lengths of geodesics emanating from a single point, as the discrete analog of the SO(n) rotation group in n-dimensional space.
- Future work:
 Study in a more qualitative way the connection of hypergraphs with groups of symmetries and a possible relation with the gauge/gravity conjecture.
Try to understand the meaning of SO(n), with n ∉  in the context of the Wolfram Models.
